# Digital Design Learning

This repository contains **SystemVerilog/Verilog implementations of digital design modules** created to practice RTL coding and verification.  
Each module includes **synthesizable RTL** and, where applicable, **self-checking testbenches** for functional validation.

---

## Features
- **Combinational Logic**  
  - Adders (n-bit, tree adder)  
  - Comparators (n-bit, function-based)  
  - Encoders / Decoders (priority, 3-to-8, 4-to-16)  
  - Multiplexers / Demultiplexers  

- **Sequential Logic**  
  - Flip-flops (DFF with reset, D latch)  
  - Counters (n-bit, Fibonacci LFSR)  
  - Shift registers (PISO, SIPO, PIPO, control-based)  

- **Memory Modules**  
  - Single-port synchronous read SRAM  
  - Dual-port asynchronous read SRAM  

- **Arithmetic Units**  
  - ALU (with self-checking testbench + golden model)  
  - Clock dividers and generators

## Tools & Environment
- **Languages:** SystemVerilog, Verilog  
- **Simulation:** ModelSim / Vivado  
- **Verification:** Self-checking testbenches, assertions  
- **Synthesis:** RTL-level, synthesizable code
